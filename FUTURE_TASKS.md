- Attack wiki. When an attack is detected, user should be able to click on it and view the attack details, what it does, how it works, etc. Maybe somehow the attack details should be accessible from timeline tags list, but dunno how, since there is not enough space. Or is there ? Anyway, in both cases, modal should be used.
